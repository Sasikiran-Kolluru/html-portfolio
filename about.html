<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My passion of web development stems from the excitement of making something actual and interesting that could link people all around. I value the artistic freedom it provides transforming ideas into feasible, visually pleasing websites that address real demands or enhance user experiences. From creating simple interfaces to coding with precision and clarity, every facet of the development process pushes me to tap both my logical and creative sides. I find great delight in seeing a project from a first concept to a completely functioning application, and the always changing web technologies motivates me to keep learning and growing.

<p>As a student, I began my education in the serene coastal city of Visakhapatnam, at Vishakha Valley School (VVS) which is nestled between two hills, just inland from the beach road. This institution, steeped in tradition and once headed by a British principal, established the groundwork for my principles and ambitions. Being raised in such a distinctive setting, where nature intertwines with culture, influenced my worldview and fostered a profound appreciation for discipline, cultural heritage, and education.

<p>Progressing in my academic journey within my hometown, I pursued a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science at GITAM University, an institution recognized for its scholarly excellence and dynamic student body. It was during this time that I explored the realm of technology more thoroughly, enhancing my skills and comprehension of computing. My origins rooted in the serenity of Vizag's landscapes and the heritage of establishments that cherish both the past and innovation,continue to motivate my aspirations as I seek to make a significant contribution in the field of computer science.</p>
